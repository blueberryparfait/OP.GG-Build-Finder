# OP.GG Build Finder

To install prerequisites, do `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

This is a tool to find builds for specific champions from the best one-tricks. It uses OP.GG to find a list of players and chooses from them in the following priority:

1. Highest rank
2. Highest winrate
3. Most games played

Then, the program will open up a webpage to that player's OP.GG profile in the user's default web browser.
